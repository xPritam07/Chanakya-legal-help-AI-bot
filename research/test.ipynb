This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell  within the \\ndefinition of murder given in sections 100 and 101 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023; that it did not fall \\nwithin any of the general exceptions of the said Sanhita;  and that it did not fall within any of the five \\nexceptions to section 101 thereof, or that, if it did fall within Exception 1, one or other of the three provisos \\nto that exception applied to it. \\n(b) A is charged under sub -section ( 2) of section 118 of the Bharatiya Nyaya  Sanhita, 2023, with \\nvoluntarily causing grievous hurt to B by means of an instrument for  shooting. This is equivalent to a \\nstatement that the case was not provided for by sub-section (2) of section 122 of the said Sanhita, and that \\nthe general exceptions did not apply to it. \\n(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-\\nmark. The charge may state that A committed murder, or  cheating, or theft, or extortion, or criminal \\nintimidation, or that he used a false propertymark,  without reference to the definitions, of those crimes \\ncontained in the Bharatiya Nyaya  Sanhita, 2023; but the sections under which the offence is punishable \\nmust, in each instance be referred to in the charge. \\n(d) A is charged under section 219 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, with intentionally obstructing \\na sale of property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant.

When manner of committing offence must be stated.—When the nature of the case is such that \\nthe particulars mentioned in sections 234 and 235 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter \\nwith which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged \\noffence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place.

The charge must set out that portion \\nof the evidence given by A which is alleged to be false. \\n(d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public  functions at a given \\ntime and place.

Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offence is punishable .—In every charge \\nwords used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sen se attached to them \\nrespectively by the law under which such offence is punishable. \\n238. Effect of errors.—No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in \\nthe charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particul ars, shall be regarded at any  stage of the \\ncase as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission,  and it has occasioned a \\nfailure of justice. \\nIllustrations. \\n(a) A is charged under section 180 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita , 2023, with “having been in \\npossession of counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin \\nwas counterfeit,” the word “fraudulently” being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact \\nmisled by this omission, the error shall not be regarded as material. \\n(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge or \\nis set out incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The \\nCourt may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material. \\n(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out  in the charge. \\nThere were many transactions between A and B , and A had no means of  knowing to which of them the \\ncharge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may infer  from such facts that the omission to set out \\nthe manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error.'),\n",

A was never \\ncharged with any murder but one, and had heard the  inquiry before the Magistrate, which referr ed \\nexclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and \\nthat the error in the charge was immaterial. \\n(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 2023, and  Khoda Baksh (who \\ntried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, 2023.

Court may alter charge .—(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before \\njudgment is pronounced. \\n(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused. \\n(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with  the trial is not \\nlikely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct \\nof the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with \\nthe trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge. \\n(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion \\nof the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a new trial \\nor adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary. \\n(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the pros ecution of which previous \\nsanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction \\nhas been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added charge \\nis founded. \\n240.
